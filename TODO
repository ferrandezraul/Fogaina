Fix news extension. 2 issues: (Might be related to the locale switch??)
But why the seed data works???
- Broken if I add a new news (even with all 3 lang)
  and then I try to switch the lang on the show page of the new created news. 
  On the other hand, If I change the lang on news created by seed data, it does not fail!!!!
- Broken if I add a new news (with only one lang)
  and then I try to switch the lang on the show page of the new created news.

Fix empty bread without english body. Think about missing other parts ..
Related might be the friendlyid from:
http://railscasts.com/episodes/314-pretty-urls-with-friendlyid?language=es&view=asciicast
Note that extension news uses friendlyid and breads extension doesn't
See the models!!

Add missing translation from news (Read more ...) etc ...
Improve layout from news at the home page. Space on link to See all news
Add

Add photo to news extension. As done with the breads extension. Note, that image shouldn't be mandatory. In the view, check it and show the logo_negro.svg if not present.
Create more seed data for news in order to see how pagination works.

I breads show page, add thumbnails images with style and clearing lightbox from foundation. 

Continue changing layout from news (index and show). Use one of those nice foundation building blocks
